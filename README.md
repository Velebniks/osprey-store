# Osprey Store

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.24.

For styling, Angular Material Design was used.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Implementation details

Due to the time limits, the following decisions have been made:

1. It's not possible to add more than one of the same backpack to the cart
1. I didn't polish styles enough
